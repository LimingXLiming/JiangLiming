### OpenSees for fire
We have been developing OpenSees for fire since 2009, which was initially led by Prof Asif Usmani at University of Edinburgh. After years of development, it has become an Open-source tool for modelling structures in fire in various aspects, which include fire modelling, heat transfer analyses, thermo-mechanical analyses, and user interface.

### OpenSees for Topology Optimization: 
Recently, we have been conducting development in OpenSees framework to achieve topology optimization based structural design, which is aimed to be a toolset for designing future structures seamlessly integrated with architecture design and empowered by 3D printing construction.
