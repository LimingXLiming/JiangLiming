Dr JIANG Liming and his team are currently working on these topics: Fire behavior in modern buildings; Structural response of tall building in fire, Hybrid simulation/testing for structures in fire; Fire-safe timber structure; Computational modelling and software development(including OpenSees for Fire and Firefoam).


## Simulation Platform: OpenSees for fire
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/structfire.jpg)
We have  been  dedicated to developing a fire edition of OpenSees  since we were in University of Edinburgh working with Prof Asif Usmani. Modelling modern buildings responding to fires, comprises various modules, such as fire models, heat trasfer module, thermo-mechanical codes. After years of development, we have also provided interface to CFD  models, intergration middleware, and preprocessor and postprocess tool  GiD for OpenSees. We have been published  a  number of publications  on OpenSees for  fire and this simulation platform has enabled large flexibility for realising the  latest research methodlogies  for simulating modern buildings in complex fires. For more information  about OpenSees for  fire, please check our project website:  openseesforfire.github.io

## Customised FDS simulation and fire testing for modern building fire safety
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/semifire.jpg)
Improving fire safety performance has been our research focus for a  long period. Modern buildings are preferablly designed with large open-plan space  and  equipped with evolving construction materials, which have significantly challenged the exisisting knowledge on fire safety design. In large compartments, the fire exhibits a travelling behaviour possibly without flashover. To consider the realistic fire scenarios, a series of travelling fire models were proposed, which includes our contribuion on bringing  the  localised  fire  models into the discreption.  More recenly, we have proposed a  nauural fire model which tends  to be  inclusive and  more sophisicated by including a  travelling behaviour model. On the simulaiton side, we have been primarily using FDS as our tool and we have been making a cusomosied FDS for our research tasks taking advantage of our long history of coding development in OpenSees and other platforms. A debugging version of FDS has been built and we are currenlty adding new feaures  into this edition.  


## Hybrid simulation/testing

Hybrid testing has been used in earthquake engineering in the recent decade, which is preferred for its capability of addressing the whole-structure response using single member laboratory tests. This project is to establish a hybrid system integrating remote numerical model and synchronous specimen test for studying the behavior of structures in fire. Using OpenFRESCO,  we  can conduct simulation using a low-resolution model representing global structural fire responses along with a high-resolution model for localised complex fire behaviour. Moreover, this high-res model can be replaced by a labortory testing specimen to enable hybrid fire testing for strucures. 

Recently, we are also working on hybrid fire testing with CFD simulation synchronized with labortory fire testing using radiant panel. This work takes advantange of our research on hybrid simulation/testing, the development of FDS, and the radiant panel testing system.

This radiant panle testing system is supported by the Large Equipment Fund. The system comprises a radiant panel complex, gas suppliers and controller items. The radiant panel covering a large range of heat flux (up to 200kw/m2 equivalent to large fires) is externally applied to the testing specimens, which enables direct observation of students on the thermal performance and fire response of building materials and devices. Particularly, each unit can be individually activated (e.g., only Unit 1, or Units 1&2, or all units) to offer high flexibility allowing various scales of testing. The system is supported by the Large Equipment Fund of PolyU.

## Fire-safe timber buildings
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/timber.jpg)
Timber is intended to become a major constructional material in future urbanization to reduce carbon emissions as a response to the climate change emergency. The fire safety of timber structures has been a long-standing challenge as timber members can contribute fuel to a fire. Traditional design approaches for timber structures have focused on estimating the char propagation in Standard fires, and the Eurocode models for timber have been devoted to this purpose. However, when considering the impact of realistic fire, the effect of non-uniform and non-standard burning in compartments indicates the key necessity of developing a suitable engineering model to estimate the realistic thermal responses of timber sections. 

## Next-generation  structural design: Construciton-oriented and Optimizaiton-based  design
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/IGAsim.jpg)
Topology optimization as a computational approach is used to find an optimal structure with specific objectives such as an ultimately lightweight design. The optimization is normally performed under a series of constraint functions to ensure expected structural performance for safety and resilience. To promote the use of topology optimization in structural engineering, it is crucially important to identify and apply suitable constraints for realistic construction. A conceptual attempt aiming for a construction-oriented topology optimization framework has been developed.An isogeometric analysis module using NURBS curves for geometric description and discretization is employed in stress analyses, which incorporates the density-based SIMP optimization approach to generate the optimized topology. We have recently develop the IGA elements and TO applciation within OpenSees and we will continue to use this for construction-oriented optimization of structural design.
