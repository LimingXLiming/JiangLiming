## A Vision of Future Buildings: optimal commbination of form, performance, and automation
#### Designs bridging achitecture concept and structural engineering 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/optimization.png)
Topology optimization as a computational approach is used to find an optimal structure with specific objectives such as an ultimately lightweight design. The optimization is normally performed under a series of constraint functions to ensure expected structural performance for safety and resilience. To promote the use of topology optimization in structural engineering, it is crucially important to identify and apply suitable constraints for realistic construction. A conceptual attempt aiming for a construction-oriented topology optimization framework has been developed.An isogeometric analysis module using NURBS curves for geometric description and discretization is employed in stress analyses, which incorporates the density-based SIMP optimization approach to generate the optimized topology. We have recently develop the IGA elements and TO applciation within OpenSees and we will continue to use this for construction-oriented optimization of structural design.

#### Using sustainable materials with asethetic finish

Timber is intended to become a major constructional material in future urbanization to reduce carbon emissions as a response to the climate change emergency. The fire safety of timber structures has been a long-standing challenge as timber members can contribute fuel to a fire. Traditional design approaches for timber structures have focused on estimating the char propagation in Standard fires, and the Eurocode models for timber have been devoted to this purpose. However, when considering the impact of realistic fire, the effect of non-uniform and non-standard burning in compartments indicates the key necessity of developing a suitable engineering model to estimate the realistic thermal responses of timber sections. 


## Integrated simulation of structures for balanced form and performance
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/structfire.jpg)
We have  been  dedicated to developing OpenSees to perform integrated simulation of structures and the fire edition was started in University of Edinburgh by Prof Asif Usmani. Modelling modern buildings responding to fires, comprises modules such as fire models, heat transfer module, thermo-mechanical codes and GUI interface. After years of development, we have enabled interface to CFD  models, integration middleware, and preprocessor and post-process tool  GiD for OpenSees. We have been published  a  number of publications  on OpenSees for  fire and this simulation platform has enabled large flexibility for realising the  latest research methodlogies  for simulating modern buildings in complex fires.

#### CFD simulation and fire testing to understand fire behaviour
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/semifire.jpg)
Improving fire safety performance of modern buildings has been an ultimate goal of our research. This has been complicated by the evolution of building design and introduction of sustainable construction materials. It has been found that a travelling behaviour can sustain in a large open-plan compartment (e.g. office) but may be replaced by a post-flashover fire after the ignition of timber members. We have been working on CFD simuilation of fires to understand the fire behaviour and a series of fire models have been proposed. On the experimental side, we have conducted a number of fire tests and we will keep doing so for validation of models. Moreover, the recently purchased H-Tris Radiant Panel testing system can provide fire-equivalent testing on building materials, as it offers unparalleled capalbility of heat flux range (0~250kW/m2) and observable responses facilitated by external heating appproach.

#### Hybrid simulation/testing based on OpenSees for fire platform
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/hybrid.jpg)
The idea of hybrid testing is to analyze global behaviour using a structural system model and to capature local behaviour of structural members using labortory tests. We know a large model using beam type elements can not describe complex local behaviour such as buckling induced by fire protection damage or localised heating, nor is possible to use full-3D detailed models for a whole building structure. Using OpenFRESCO as middleware and OpenSees for fire platform, we are hoping to use hybrid simulation/testing techniques to reshape the research methodlogy when evaluating modern buildings in fire. More excitingly, we can bring the AI approach into the simulation framework and relvant papers will come out soon. 

## Testing Facilities
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Panel.jpg)
This radiant panle testing system is supported by the Large Equipment Fund. The system comprises a radiant panel complex, gas suppliers and controller items. The radiant panel covering a large range of heat flux (up to 200kw/m2 equivalent to large fires) is externally applied to the testing specimens, which enables direct observation of students on the thermal performance and fire response of building materials and devices. Particularly, each unit can be individually activated (e.g., only Unit 1, or Units 1&2, or all units) to offer high flexibility allowing various scales of testing. 

Additionally, we have built a scaled compartment (1.8mX1.2mX0.9m) for testing on fire behaviour in semi-confined compartments. We also own these falicties: a portable graphic datalogger, heat flux gauge, a work station for high-performance computation and development boards.
