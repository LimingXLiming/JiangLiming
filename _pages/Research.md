Dr JIANG Liming and his team are currently working on these topics: Fire behavior in modern buildings; Structural response of tall building in fire, Hybrid simulation/testing for structures in fire; Fire-safe timber structure; Computational modelling and software development(including OpenSees for Fire and Firefoam).

## FIre behaviour in modern buildings

Modern buildings are commonly designed with large open-plan space. The fire behaviour in these buildings has been found out of the regime of traditional design fire scenarios, which normally assume The typical travelling fire scenarios have been summarized by extracting the data from the seven full scale travelling fire tests since 2010.  To consider the realistic fire scenarios in large-open plan compartments, a series of travelling fire scenarios are proposed, which employs variable flame spread speeds and fire sizes instead of constant travelling speed and fire size as adopted in the current models. 


## Structural response to fires

Modelling tall buildings responding to fires, especially multi-floor fires, requires the
consideration of composite slabs as the composite action can significantly affect the structure
fire response. Modelling composite slabs in fire is tedious and complex due to the existence of
ribs and complicated thermal action. In view of the complexity of the existing modelling
approaches, this paper aims to propose a novel approach for modelling composite slabs in fire.


## Hybrid simulation/testing

Hybrid testing has been used in earthquake engineering in the recent decade, which is preferred for its capability of addressing the whole-structure response using single member laboratory tests. This project is to establish a hybrid system integrating remote numerical model and synchronous specimen test for studying the behavior of structures in fire.

## Fire-safe timber buiildings

Timber is intended to become a major constructional material in future urbanization to reduce carbon emissions as a response to the climate change emergency. The fire safety of timber structures has been a long-standing challenge as timber members can contribute fuel to a fire. Traditional design approaches for timber structures have focused on estimating the char propagation in Standard fires, and the Eurocode models for timber have been devoted to this purpose. However, when considering the impact of realistic fire, the effect of non-uniform and non-standard burning in compartments indicates the key necessity of developing a suitable engineering model to estimate the realistic thermal responses of timber sections. 

## Advanced modelling and testing

To promote the use of topology optimization in structural engineering, it is crucially important to identify and apply suitable constraints for realistic construction. In this paper, a conceptual attempt aiming for a construction-oriented topology optimization framework.

The system comprises a radiant panel complex, gas suppliers and controller items. The radiant panel covering a large range of heat flux (up to 200kw/m2 equivalent to large fires) is externally applied to the testing specimens, which enables direct observation of students on the thermal performance and fire response of building materials and devices. Particularly, each unit can be individually activated (e.g., only Unit 1, or Units 1&2, or all units) to offer high flexibility allowing various scales of testing. The system is supported by the Large Equipment Fund of PolyU.
