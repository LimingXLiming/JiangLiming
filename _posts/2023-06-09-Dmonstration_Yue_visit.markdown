## Academician Yue and his team visit our lab
On 09 June 2023, a visiting group led by Academician YUE Qingrui visit our fire lab and watched our demonstration with e-controlled radiant panel testing system. Tianwei and Cheng helped the demonstration, which was running smoothly. We are now able to use a computer to operate the radiant panel system and we are conducting further development to enhance its testing capability.
