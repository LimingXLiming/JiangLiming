## UGC fund for technology in education awarded
We have been informed that our proposal for UGC Fund for Technology in Education has been approved and awarded (PI: Liming Jiang, Co-PIs: Dr Cynthia Hou and Dr Hilda Cheung). This (200K HKD) would provide additional support to the the construction of VR platform for building sciences and engineering (including fire safety engineering).
