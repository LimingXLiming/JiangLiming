## RISUD Joint Research Fund
We have been informed that our RISUD Joint Research Fund has been approved, which provides us 1.2M HKD of research funding. This project aims to develop components of 3D concrete printer to better fit the construction need. We have been supported by the Co-PIs (Prof Mao Lei from USTC, Dr Weng Yiwei from BRE POlyU) and Co-Is (Prof Asif Usmani, Prof Wang Preijun from Shandong University, Dr Yurvaj Sahni). We are now looking for Post-docs under this project support.
