## International conference on structures in fire (SIF2022) will be hosted by PolyU
##### co-chairs of organising committee: Prof Asif Usmani and Dr Liming Jiang
The next SiF conference will be organised by Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The date is 30 Nov- 2 Dec, 2022. We submitted the bid form and competed with three other institutes with a success. We will start to prepare for the conference and look forward to it with the hope of hosting an international conference physically after the pandemic of COVID-19.
