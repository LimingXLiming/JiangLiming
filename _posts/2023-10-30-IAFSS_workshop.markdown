## Dr Jiang co-chaired "structures" workshop in IAFSS2023
On 29 Oct 2023, Dr Jiang co-chaired the 'Structures" workshop with Dr Thomas Gernay right before the opening of the IAFSS symoposium, which is one of workshops held in the two-day workshop warmup before IAFSS. We have met a number of friends during the workshop and had very inspiring discussions during the workshop on the two themes: What is the future of modelling software for structures in fire; and what is the future research need for structures in fire.
