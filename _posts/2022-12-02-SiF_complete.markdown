## Ending Ceremony of SiF2022
SiF2022 adopted a hybrid mode including online and in-person presentation at PolyU for broader access and the registration fees of two tiers are offered. We would like to thank all the in-person and online delegates of SiF2022 and all the speakers presenting their fascinating work. We are grateful for the support form SiF Steering Committee, SiF2022 Local Organising Committee, SiF2022 Scientific Committee, and all the SiF2022 volunteers!For more information about SiF2022, please visit: sif2022.org
