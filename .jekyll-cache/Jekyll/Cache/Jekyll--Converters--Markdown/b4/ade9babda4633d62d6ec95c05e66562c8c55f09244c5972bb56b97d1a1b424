<p>The next SiF conference will be organised by Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The date is 30 Nov- 2 Dec, 2022. We really appreciate being chosen to host the SIF 2022 by the steering committee. Most of research activities have been intervened by the COVID and particularly the international conferences. We will be prepared to host SIF in PolyU and truly look forward to an international conference with many face-to-face contacts after the pandemic of COVID-19.</p>
